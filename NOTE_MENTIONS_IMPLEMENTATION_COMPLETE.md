# Note Mentions Implementation - Complete ✅

## Overview
Successfully implemented note author display, @mention tagging with autocomplete, and in-app notifications for tagged users in the CRM notes system.

## What Was Implemented

### Database Changes ✅
1. **Schema Update** (`shared/schema.ts`)
   - Added `mentionedUsers: text("mentioned_users").array()` field to `crmNotes` table
   - Stores array of user IDs who were mentioned in the note

2. **Migration Applied**
   - Created and applied migration to add `mentioned_users` column to database
   - Migration file: `migrations/0030_add_mentions_to_notes.sql`

### Backend Changes ✅

3. **Storage Layer Updates** (`server/storage.ts`)
   - Added `parseUserMentions()` helper function to extract user IDs from @[userId:Name] format
   - Updated `getCrmNotes()` to join with users table and return author information (name, email)
   - Updated `createCrmNote()` to automatically parse mentions and store user IDs
   - Extended `getNotifications()` to include note mentions with entity context

4. **API Routes Updates** (`server/routes.ts`)
   - Modified `POST /api/crm/notes` to emit WebSocket events to mentioned users
   - Integrated with existing Socket.IO setup for real-time notifications
   - Note creation now triggers `note_mention` event for tagged users

### Frontend Components ✅

5. **MentionTextarea Component** (`client/src/components/crm/mention-textarea.tsx`)
   - Custom textarea with @ mention autocomplete
   - Detects @ symbol and shows dropdown of company users
   - Converts selections to @[userId:Name] format for storage
   - Displays as @Name to users for clean UX
   - Filters users as you type

6. **NoteItem Component** (`client/src/components/crm/note-item.tsx`)
   - Displays notes with author information
   - Format: "Author Name • timestamp"
   - Parses and renders @mentions as clickable badges
   - Clean, card-based layout

7. **Updated CRM Detail Pages**
   - `client/src/pages/crm/crm-contact-detail.tsx`
   - `client/src/pages/crm/crm-deal-detail.tsx`
   - `client/src/pages/crm/crm-unit-detail.tsx`
   
   All three pages now:
   - Use MentionTextarea instead of plain Textarea
   - Fetch and pass company users for autocomplete
   - Display notes using NoteItem component with author info
   - Support real-time mention detection

8. **Notification Center** (`client/src/components/crm/notification-center.tsx`)
   - Added "Mentions" section with @ icon
   - Shows notes where user was tagged
   - Displays mention preview with author and entity context
   - Links directly to the entity (Contact/Deal/Unit)
   - Real-time updates via WebSocket
   - Toast notification when mentioned

## How It Works

### Creating a Note with Mentions

1. User types in note field and presses `@`
2. Autocomplete dropdown appears with company users
3. User selects someone (e.g., "John Doe")
4. Text is inserted as `@[userId:John Doe]`
5. Displayed to user as `@John Doe` (clean format)
6. On submit:
   - Backend parses mentions and extracts user IDs
   - Stores IDs in `mentionedUsers` array
   - Emits WebSocket event to each mentioned user
   - Creates activity log entry

### Receiving Mention Notifications

1. User receives WebSocket event with mention details
2. Toast notification appears: "John mentioned you in a note"
3. Notification center badge increments
4. Bell icon shows new mention in "Mentions" section
5. Clicking mention navigates to the entity (Contact/Deal/Unit)
6. Note displays with highlighted @mention badges

### Viewing Notes

- Each note shows: **Author Name** • timestamp
- Mentions appear as badges: @John Doe
- Clicking a mention badge can trigger actions (optional)
- Notes are displayed in chronological order

## Data Flow

```
User types @ → Autocomplete → Select user → Insert @[userId:Name]
                                                    ↓
                                             Submit note
                                                    ↓
                                   Backend parses @[userId:Name]
                                                    ↓
                                   Store [userId] in array
                                                    ↓
                                   Emit WebSocket event
                                                    ↓
                          Mentioned user receives notification
                                                    ↓
                               Notification center updates
```

## Technical Details

### Mention Format
- **Stored**: `@[userId:DisplayName]` (e.g., `@[abc123:John Doe]`)
- **Displayed**: `@DisplayName` (e.g., `@John Doe`)
- **Parsed**: Regex `/@@\[([^:]+):[^\]]+\]/g` extracts user IDs

### Database Schema
```sql
ALTER TABLE crm_notes 
ADD COLUMN mentioned_users text[]
```

### WebSocket Events
- Event: `note_mention`
- Payload: `{ noteId, entityType, entityId, mentionedBy }`
- Triggers: Notification center refresh + toast
