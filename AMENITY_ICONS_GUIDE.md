## Usage

### Admin/Manager Interface
1. Navigate to Parks management
2. When editing a park, go to the Amenities section
3. For each amenity:
   - Select an icon from the dropdown (left side)
   - Enter the amenity name (right side)
4. Click the + button to add the amenity

### Display
- Amenities are displayed on the park detail page with their selected icons
- If an old amenity exists (string format), it will be displayed with the default icon (check mark)
- The system is backwards compatible with the old string-based amenity format

## Technical Details

### Data Format
Amenities are now stored as objects:
```json
{
  "name": "Swimming Pool",
  "icon": "waves"
}
```

### Backwards Compatibility
The system automatically converts old string format amenities to the new object format:
- Old: `["Swimming Pool", "Fitness Center"]`
- New: `[{name: "Swimming Pool", icon: "check"}, {name: "Fitness Center", icon: "check"}]`

### Files Modified
- `client/src/pages/park-detail.tsx` - Icon pool definition and display logic
- `client/src/pages/admin-parks.tsx` - Icon selection interface for admins
- `client/src/pages/manager-parks.tsx` - (Should be updated similarly for consistency)
